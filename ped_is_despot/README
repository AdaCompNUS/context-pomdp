Launch sequence for MOMDP experiment:

|**************|
| For golfcar: |
****************
!!FIXME: Re-verify the launch sequence!!
High level computer
-------------------
./run-core
roslaunch Launch 0GolfcarSensors.launch 

Low level computer
------------------
./run-lowlevel
roslaunch Launch 1LowLevel.launch 
roslaunch Launch 12StartControl.launch

High level computer
-------------------
roslaunch Launch 2LocalizationFake.launch
roslaunch ped_is_despot 3Autonomous.launch
(Re-position the golfcar position using RViz's 2D Pose Estimate when necessary)
roslaunch Launch 4pedestrian_detect.launch

Rinse and repeat steps below at high level computer:
----------------------------------------------------
(Specify the pedestrian ID at ped_is_despot's momdp.launch and start recording)
(Turn on autonomous mode )
roslaunch ped_is_despot momdp.launch
(Goal position will be automatically given by momdp at (3,25) in "map" frame)

|***********************|
| For stage simulation: |
*************************

roslaunch ped_is_despot simulation.launch
roslaunch Launch 3Autonomous_momdp.launch
roslaunch ped_is_despot momdp.launch
roslaunch Launch 5RoutePlannerSpeedAdvisor_momdp.launch 

To start the simulation, give a straight goal point using "2D Nav Goal" in RViz. When the simulated vehicle is started moving, use "Interact" to move the simulated pedestrian boxes to investigate the respond of the vehicle due to the movement of the pedestrian.
To restart the simulation, simply drag the simulated vehicle in Stage back to original location and start by giving "2D Nav Goal" again.
Please note: The position of the simulated pedestrian is only updated whenever there is a movement of the pedestrian.
